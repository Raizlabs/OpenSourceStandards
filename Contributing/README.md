## Contributing
Here is a template for the Contributing.MD file that we are going to start including in all of our repo's.  Make sure to update the template to include the required information

## Use

 - Add a CONTRIBUTING.MD file to your root folder of your git library.  Github will automatically link to it when PR's are opened.
 - Make sure to update the information to be relevant to your project and to update the code style link for your language.
